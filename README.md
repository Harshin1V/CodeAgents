# ðŸŒŸ Evolution of AI Agents

- **Conversable Agents** â†’ Basic chatting (LLM responds to prompts).
- **Tool-Calling Agents** â†’ LLMs can invoke external tools/functions.
- **Router Agents** â†’ Directs tasks to specialized agents/tools.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning Agents** â†’ Plans sequences of actions (reasoning chains).
- **Web Agents** â†’ Navigate and interact with websites autonomously.
- **MCTS Planning Agents (Agent Q)** â†’ Simulates multiple action paths, picks optimal.
- **Self-Critiquing Agents** â†’ Evaluates own actions before executing.
- **Feedback-Learning Agents** â†’ Improves by learning from feedback (success/failure).
- **Memory Agents** â†’ Stores and uses long-term memory for smarter actions.
- **Self-Improving Agents** â†’ Continuously fine-tunes and evolves without manual retraining.
